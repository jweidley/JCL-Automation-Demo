tests_include:
  - check_core
check_core:
  - command: show system core-dumps
  - iterate:
      xpath:  '//multi-routing-engine-results/multi-routing-engine-item/re-name/directory-list'
      tests:
        - not-exists: ./directory/file-information/file-name
          err: "Test Failed!!core file exist <{{post['./directory/file-information/filename']}}> on {{post['./../re-name']}}"
          info: "Test Succeeded!!!There is no core file"
